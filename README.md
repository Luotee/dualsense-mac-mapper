# 🎮 DualSense Mac Mapper
A Python-based key remapper for macOS (Apple Silicon) that maps every button and axis on a PS5 DualSense controller to keyboard keys — including macros, deadzone filtering, and customizable mappings.

## Why this exists?
Background This project was born in May 2025. While playing MapleStory Worlds Artale with my wife, I looked for a controller mapping tool to save her from the discomfort of long sessions on a MacBook keyboard.

After testing multiple macOS mapping tools from both the App Store and GitHub, I found a recurring issue: keys would frequently get "stuck." This happened because the software registered the "button down" event but missed the "button up" signal. Frustrated after trying several unsuccessful solutions, I turned to ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to build this tool from scratch. Remarkably, except for fine-tuning the DEADZONE and THRESHOLD parameters, the code was entirely generated by AI.

## Test environment
- Macbook M2 (macOS 15.5) & Python 3.13.5
- Windows 11 & Python 3.11

## 🚀 Features
- Full button remapping (buttons 0–14)
- Analog stick and trigger normalization (added as virtual keys 15–24)
- Deadzone support and trigger threshold control
- Custom macro definition system with randomized delays
- Pygame + pynput based — no special kernel extensions needed
- Joystick reconnection recovery supported (only tested on win11)

## 🔧 Required libraries
```bash
pip install pygame pynput
```
